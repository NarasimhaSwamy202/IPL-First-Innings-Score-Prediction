![IPL-captains]([text](static/ipl_group.avif))

## Overview

Introducing the Inaugural Innings Score Prediction IPL Project! Employing machine learning, this initiative forecasts the first innings score in cricket matches by leveraging diverse input parameters. The predictive model is coded in Python, with Jupyter Notebook as the primary development tool. Additionally, HTML, CSS, Flask, and Heroku are integral components for crafting an intuitive web interface to enhance user experience.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- HTML
- CSS
- Flask
- Heroku
- Visual Studio Code

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/` : Contains the Python code for the machine learning model implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.
- `templates/` : Includes HTML templates for the web interface.
- `static/` : Contains CSS files for styling the web interface.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine. `git clone https://github.com/NarasimhaSwamy202/IPL-First-Innings-Score-Prediction.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the python file: `python app.py`

## Usage
1. Select the batting and bowling teams.
2. Enter the number of overs, runs, wickets, runs_in_prev_5, and wickets_in_prev_5 as input parameters.
3. Click on the "Predict" button to get the predicted first innings score.
